# ExtJS 4.x for Rails 3.2 Asset Pipeline

ExtJS is a JavaScript application framework featuring expanded
functionality, plugin-free charting, and a new MVC architecture.

The extjs-rails project integrates ExtJS into the Rails 3.2 asset
pipeline.

ExtJS is a GPL v3 licensed framework. Because this package distributes
the framework it is also being licensed under the GPL v3.

However the same construct should be applicable to the commercial
licensed version of ExtJS. So please feel free to fork the project.
